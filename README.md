# Mycosis

The rebirth nobody expected! Mycosis is a [free](LICENSE) video game run under
the ZDoom engine, with most of the game's source code written in
[ZDCode](https://github.com/Gustavo6046/ZDCode) for Zandronum compatibility, set
around an unique science-fiction plot, with fantasy and steampunk elements, and
original Impulse Tracker music.
